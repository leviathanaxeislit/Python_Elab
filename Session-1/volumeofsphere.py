Thanvi's Maths teacher taught that a sphere is a three-dimensional solid with no face, no edge, no base and no vertex. 
It is a round body with all points on its surface equidistant from the center. 
The volume of a sphere is measured in cubic units.  
Can you help her to find the volume of the sphere for the given radius?
